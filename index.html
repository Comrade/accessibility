	<h2>Bypass Blocks</h2>
    <p>A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages. When this Success Criterion is not satisfied, it may be difficult for people with some disabilities to reach the main content of a Web page quickly and easily.</p>
	<p>An example of this would be a link at the top of each page which would allow users to bypass the navigation to avoid having to listen to it being read over and over again.</p>
	<div class="cell margin-bottom">

		<a href="#navigation-mechanisms"><small>Skip Navigation &rarr;</small></a><br>

	<div class="full">
		<h2>Link Purpose (In Context)</h2>
		<p>The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general. (Level A)</p>
		<div class="cell margin-bottom">
			<h3>Example</h3>

	<h2>Focus Order</h2>

		<h2>More things to remember</h2>

	<h1>Predictable</h1>

	<h2>On Focus</h2>
	<p>When any component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context.</p>
	<div class="cell margin-bottom">
		<h3>Examples:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Forms should not be submitted automatically when a component receives focus. So tabbing onto a submit button should not trigger the button action.</li>
			<li>New windows should not be launched when a component receives focus.</li>
			<li>Focus should not be changed to another component when that component receives focus.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h2 class="clear">On Input</h2>
	<p>Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component. This Success Criterion helps users with disabilities by making interactive content more predictable. Unexpected changes of context can be so disorienting for users with visual disabilities or cognitive limitations that they are unable to use the content. Individuals who are unable to detect changes of context are less likely to become disoriented while navigating a site.</p>
	<div class="cell margin-bottom">
		<h3>Examples:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Individuals who are blind or have low vision may have difficulty knowing when a visual context change has occurred, such as a new window popping up. In this case, warning users of context changes in advance minimizes confusion when the user discovers that the back button no longer behaves as expected.</li>
			<li>Some individuals with low vision, with reading and intellectual disabilities, and others who have difficulty interpreting visual cues may benefit from additional cues in order to detect changes of context.</li>
